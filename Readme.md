# Digital Computer Electronics

I am re-reading Digital Computer Electronics by Malvino and Brown. As I do so,
I am reproducing and experimenting with the circuits in
[Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) and
possibly using an FPGA board, if possible my DE0 Cyclone or DE10-Nano as my
ALINX AX309 Spartan 6 is now difficult to work with because of its age.
